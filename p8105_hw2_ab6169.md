## Problem 1

First, I loaded my libraries

Cleaning the `pols-month.csv` data

``` r
pols_df= 
  read_csv("data_hw2/pols-month.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) |>
  janitor:: clean_names() |> 
separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") |>
mutate(
  year = as.integer(year),
  month = as.integer(month),
  month = month.name[month],
  president = ifelse(prez_gop == 1|2, "gop", "dem")) |>
  select(-day, -prez_gop, -prez_dem)
```

Cleaning the `snp.csv` data

``` r
snp_df= 
  read_csv("data_hw2/snp.csv", na = c("NA", ".", ""))|>
  janitor:: clean_names() |> 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") |>
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = as.integer(month),
    month = month.name[month]) |>
  mutate(year=(ifelse(year>25, 1900+year, 2000+year))) |> 
  select(year, month, close, -day) |>
  arrange(year, month)
```

Cleaning the `unemployment.csv` data

``` r
unemployment_df= 
  read_csv("data_hw2/unemployment.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) |>
pivot_longer(
    cols = Jan:Dec,      
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    month = case_match(
      month,
      "Jan" ~ "January",
      "Feb" ~ "February",
      "Mar" ~ "March",
      "Apr" ~ "April",
      "May" ~ "May",
      "Jun" ~ "June",
      "Jul" ~ "July",
      "Aug" ~ "August",
      "Sep" ~ "September",
      "Oct" ~ "October",
      "Nov" ~ "November",
      "Dec" ~ "December") ) |> 
  rename(year = Year) |>
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

Merging `snp.csv` and `pol-month.csv` and `unemployment.csv`

``` r
merged_df= 
pols_df |>
  left_join(snp_df, by = c("year", "month")) |>
  left_join(unemployment_df, by = c("year", "month"))
```

Write-Up:

The `pols-month.csv` dataset contains information about political
leaders,including the number of governors, senators, and
representatives, along with the party of the president at the time. The
`snp.csv` dataset provides the closing values of the S&P stock index by
year and month. The `unemployment.csv` dataset reports monthly
unemployment percentages for each year.

After cleaning and merging, the resulting dataset has 822 observations,
covering the years1947 to 2015. Key variables include `year`, `month`,
`president`, `close`, and `unemployment`.

## Problem 2

``` r
mr_trash_df =
  read_excel("data_hw2/trashwheeldatanew.xlsx", 
             sheet= "Mr. Trash Wheel",na= c("NA", ".", "")) |> 
janitor:: clean_names() |> 
drop_na(dumpster) |> 
select(-x15, -x16) |>
 mutate(
  year = as.integer(year),
  sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)),
  wheel= "Mr.Trash Wheel"
)

prof_trash_df =
  read_excel("data_hw2/trashwheeldatanew.xlsx",
             sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
             na = c("NA", ".", "")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    wheel = "Professor Trash Wheel") 


gwynns_df =
  read_excel("data_hw2/trashwheeldatanew.xlsx",
             sheet = "Gwynns Falls Trash Wheel",na = c("NA", ".", "")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  drop_na(dumpster) |> 
  mutate(
    wheel = "Gwynns Fall Trash Wheel") 

trash_wheel_df =
  bind_rows(mr_trash_df, prof_trash_df, gwynns_df) |>
  janitor:: clean_names() |>
  relocate(wheel, year, month)
```

Write-up

The Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel, and Gwynnda datasets track
the trash collected from Baltimore’s harbor. Each row represents a
dumpster, with variables for the date, total trash weight, and counts of
items such asplastic bottles, cigarette butts, and sports balls.

After combining all three datasets, the final tidy dataset has 1188
total observations. Key variables include `year`, `month`,
`weight_tons`, `cigarette_butts`, and `sports_balls`.

Professor Trash Wheel has collected a total of 282.26 tons of trash.In
June 2022, Gwynnda collected 1.812^{4}cigarette butts.

## Problem 3

``` r
zipcodes_df= 
  read_csv("data_hw2/zipcodes.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  select(-state_fips, -file_date) 

zori_df = 
  read_csv("data_hw2/zipnyc.csv", na = c("NA", ".", "")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("x20"),
    names_to = "date",
    values_to = "zori"
  ) |> 
  rename(
    zip_code= region_name,) |> 
  select(-city, -metro, -region_type, -state_name, -state, -county_name) |> 
  mutate(date = sub("^x", "", date))

#Joined DataFrame
mergezip_df=
  left_join(zipcodes_df, zori_df, by = "zip_code","county") 
```

    ## Warning in left_join(zipcodes_df, zori_df, by = "zip_code", "county"): Detected an unexpected many-to-many relationship between `x` and `y`.
    ## ℹ Row 1 of `x` matches multiple rows in `y`.
    ## ℹ Row 4757 of `y` matches multiple rows in `x`.
    ## ℹ If a many-to-many relationship is expected, set `relationship =
    ##   "many-to-many"` to silence this warning.

Writeup: I cleaned and merged the Zillow Observed Rent Index (zori)
dataset with the ZIP code information. From this, I got a single tidy
dataset, `mergezip_df`. The final dataset has 17687 total observations.
Many rows of the ZORI dataset contain missing values because Zillow did
not report rent for those ZIP codes or months

``` r
#Shows which ZIP codes appear in the ZIP code dataset but not in the Zillow Rental Price dataset
missing_zips_df =
  anti_join(zipcodes_df, zori_df, by = "zip_code","county")
```

Illustrative Examples:

These zipcodes might be excluded from the Zillow dataset for various
reason. For example, zipcode 10112 covers Rockefeller Center and office
towers so Zillow cannot track rents if they don’t have residential
rental markets. Zipcode 10048 could be excluded since it is the one and
only valid zip code for any Tennant and office located in the original
World Trade Center complex. So, it is assigned for historical or
institutional use and not for active housing. Lastly,

``` r
covid_change_df =
  mergezip_df |>
  filter(date %in% c("2020_01_31", "2021_01_31")) |>
  select(zip_code, county, neighborhood, date, zori) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = date,
    values_from = zori,
    names_prefix = "year_"
  ) |>
  mutate(change = year_2021_01_31 - year_2020_01_31) |>
  drop_na(change)
```

Comments: The `covid_change_df` compares ZORI rental prices in January
2020 and January 2021 for all available NYC ZIP codes. The dataset has
84 observations. Each showing the rent change across one ZIP code. The
largest rent decrease was -912.5965909 while the largest increase was
101.2020504. This highlights the fluctuations in rental prices during
the COVID-19 pandemic.
